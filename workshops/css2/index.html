    <h1> real hot girl back pain </h1>
    <p>A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
And he said to the man, running the stand
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"
The man said
"No we just sell lemonade. But it's cold
And it's fresh
And it's all home-made. Can I get you
Glass?"
The duck said,
"I'll pass".
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle)
'Til the very next day.
(Bum bum bum bum ba-bada-dum)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?
The man said,
"No, like I said yesterday
We just sell lemonade OK?
Why not give it a try?"
The duck said,
"Goodbye."good day
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away
(Waddle waddle)
'Til the very next day.
(Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes?
The man said,
Look, this is getting old.
I mean, lemonade's all we've ever sold.
Why not give it a go?"
The duck said,
"How 'bout, no."
Then he waddled away
(Waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away
(Waddle waddle)
'Til the very next day.
(Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"
The man said,
"THAT'S IT!
If you don't stay away, duck,
I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day, stuck
So don't get to close!"
The duck said,
"Adios."
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away
(Waddle waddle)
'Til the very next day.
(Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum)
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man that was running the stand,
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) got any glue?"
"What"
"Got any glue?"
"No, why would Iâ€“ oh!"
And one more question for you;
"Got any grapes?"
(Bum bum bum, bum bum bum)
And the man just stopped.
Then he started to smile.
He started to laugh.
He laughed for a while.
He said,
"Come on duck, let's walk to the store.
I'll buy you some grapes
So you won't have to ask anymore."
So they walked to the store
And the man bought some grapes.
He gave one to the duck and the duck said,
"Hmmm..No thanks. But you know what sounds good?
It would make my day.
Do you think this store
Do you think this store
Do you think this store has any lemonade?"
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle waddle)
Then he waddled away
